## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I am a researcher in the humanities working on an EU funded project at University of Gothenburg.

## Research Interest

My research investigates the relationship between literature and labor. Specifically, I am interested in the cultural significance of issues like social class, unemployment, precarity and automation and its affilliations and disconnections with literature. My work has appeared in journals like Textual Practice, ASAP journal, symplokÄ“, Contemporary Literature and in several anthologies. I am currently writing a book on the literary history of unemployment since 1930.
